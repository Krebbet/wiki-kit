# Wiki Lint

Perform a health check of the wiki.

## Process

1. **Read all wiki pages** — glob `wiki/**/*.md` and read each file.

2. **Check for orphan pages** — pages with no inbound `[[wiki-link]]` references. `index.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `revisions.md`, and `log.md` are exempt.

3. **Check for broken links** — `[[wiki-link]]` references pointing to pages that don't exist.

4. **Check for missing cross-references** — concepts mentioned in body text that have their own page but aren't linked on first mention.

5. **Check for conflicts** — statements on one page that conflict with statements on another. Pay attention to pages that cite the same raw source. Cross-reference any open files in `wiki/conflicts/`.

6. **Check for coverage gaps** — important concepts discussed in `raw/` source documents that have no wiki page or are only mentioned in passing.

7. **Check for stale content** — pages that reference outdated tools, deprecated practices, or unresolved TODOs.

8. **Check page format compliance** — every page must have: `# Title`, summary paragraph, `## Source` section, `## Related` section with `[[wiki-link]]`s.

9. **Audit raw capture fidelity** — for every topic directory under `raw/`, run:

   ```bash
   poetry run python -m tools.audit_captures raw/<topic-dir>
   ```

   The tool checks: (a) every image ref in each captured markdown resolves to a real file, (b) every captured markdown has a paired source PDF in `pdfs/`, (c) markdown size is sane vs source PDF page count, (d) no image filename is referenced by more than one markdown (cross-paper overwrite indicator). Include any non-zero issues in the lint report under the **Capture Fidelity** section. Captures with broken refs or thin extractions are likely silent failures of `capture_pdf` and need re-capture before downstream synthesis can be trusted.

10. **Domain-specific checks** — research-wiki for LLM fine-tuning method development:
    a. **Paper identifier present** — every page citing a paper has the ArXiv ID (e.g., `arXiv:2401.12345`) or DOI in its `## Source` section.
    b. **Conceptual cross-links** — method pages link to at least one related-method page, not only papers they cite. The conceptual graph matters as much as the citation graph.
    c. **Quantitative claims cite figures** — pages making numeric claims ("X% improvement", "Y× more sample-efficient") cite the specific table or figure number from the source.
    d. **Research-page schema** — pages under `wiki/research/` have `## Method` and `## Claims` sections in addition to the standard `## Source` and `## Related`.
    e. **Recency check for fast-moving topics** — flag pages on RL, LLM training, or post-training methods whose only sources are older than 5 years. (Foundational papers older than that are fine, but the page should also reference recent follow-ups.)

**Persist the report before presenting it.** Write the full report to `wiki/lint-reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (creating the directory if needed; if a report for today already exists, append `-v2`, `-v3`, etc. to the filename). Then present the report inline in chat along with a pointer to the persisted file — the user wants a durable artefact they can review separately from the conversation.

**After presenting the report:**

1. **Auto-ingest un-ingested raw sources.** Under the **Coverage Gaps** section, distinguish two categories of gaps:
   - *Conceptual gaps* — concepts discussed in an already-ingested source that are thin or missing on the wiki. These need human judgement; surface them for the user and do nothing automatic.
   - *Un-ingested raw sources* — files under `raw/` that have no corresponding coverage in any wiki page (no `## Source` entry pointing to them). For each such file, run the `/ingest` process inline on it. Apply the same phase-transition signposting as `/research` step 6:

     > — lint identified un-ingested source: `<path>`; running ingest —

     Proceed with `/ingest`'s process on that file: read it, discuss takeaways, wait for user input on emphasis, write or update wiki pages, update tracking. When that file's ingest ends, announce:

     > — ingest of `<path>` complete; returning to lint —

     Repeat for each un-ingested source.

2. **Remaining issues.** Ask: "Would you like me to fix any of the other issues in the report?" (broken links, format compliance, stale content, etc.). If yes, apply fixes.

3. **Tracking.** Whether the user accepts any fixes or not, append an entry to `wiki/revisions.md` recording the lint run and update `wiki/log.md` with a dated lint entry. The persisted report file is the durable artefact; the tracking files record that the run happened.

## Harvest checkpoint

Before finishing, ask: did this lint surface anything that would help *any* wiki, not just this one? Examples: a new class of issue worth adding as a generic lint check, a pattern in orphans suggesting `/ingest` or `/research` could be smarter, a bug in `audit_captures`. If yes, append a brief entry to `master_notes.md` with `Scope: kit` and `Status: open`, and mention it inline so the user sees the flag. `/harvest` will pick it up.
